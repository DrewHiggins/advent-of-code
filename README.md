Advent of Code
--------------

These are some of my solutions for the 2015 [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).

Each day's solution is labeled as `dayX.rb` and its corresponding input data and problem prompt can be found in the `inputs/` and `problems/` folders respectively.

Update: December ended up being busier than anticipated, so I only got through 5 of the challenges. I suppose I'll keep this up though ðŸ™ƒ
